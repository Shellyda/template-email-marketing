# Creating Email Marketing Template

In this project, we will delve into the concept of Email Marketing (HTML files sent via email), utilizing basic knowledge of HTML and CSS to craft a straightforward template. If you wish to delve deeper into HTML and CSS, please feel free to [click here](https://github.com/Shellyda/studies-html-css-basic) for additional study resources.

This personal project was undertaken during the Danki Code's 'Complete Front-End' course.

## Project Observations

It is crucial to note that **Email templates** adhere to a standardized construction format, typically utilizing an older version of HTML **(XHTML 1.0 Transitional)**. Consequently, only specific tags such as tables, images, and links can be used, excluding others like margin, position, float, background-image due to **compatibility reasons**.

### Table Tags:

- **tr** - Rows
- **td** - Elements
- **table** - The overarching structure

#### Important: 
While we can place a **TABLE** inside an **ELEMENT** (TD), we should never place a **ROW** (TR) inside an **ELEMENT** (TD). Respecting this hierarchy is essential!

-------------------------

## Recommendations

- **Remove** the default internal spacing of tables using: `<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>`.

- In image elements, always set the display as block to avoid conflicts on Email platforms: `<img style="display:block;"></img>`.
-  Additionally, include the 'alt' attribute to provide an image description: `<img alt="my description" style="display: block;"></img>`.

- **Validate the document** using the W3C validator to ensure compliance with standards. [Click here](https://validator.w3.org/) to access the site.

- Keep in mind that integrating an Email sending system on your website requires Back-End knowledge. Images must be hosted on an external online server for correct email delivery.
